## 🧩 What You’ll Learn Today

Today’s lesson introduces the structure, models, and responsibilities within a Security Operations Center (SOC). You’ll learn about different SOC types, analyst tiers, and how teams collaborate to protect an organization’s digital assets.

## 📘 Key Concepts & Definitions

### **Security Operations Center (SOC)**

📘 **Definition:**  
A SOC is a centralized unit that monitors, detects, investigates, and responds to cybersecurity threats in real time using specialized tools and processes.

🧠 **Example:**  
SOC teams use SIEM platforms like Splunk or QRadar to monitor logs and alerts from firewalls, endpoints, and servers.

*“A SOC is like a digital control room where experts monitor systems to catch and stop cyber threats—just like security guards watching CCTV feeds in a building.”*

### **Global SOC**

📘 **Definition:**  
A Global SOC is a distributed SOC model where cybersecurity teams across different geographic locations collaborate to monitor and respond to threats 24/7.

🧠 **Example:**  
A company with offices in North America, Europe, and Asia uses a follow-the-sun model to ensure continuous threat monitoring.

*“A Global SOC is like a worldwide security team working in shifts to keep watch over your systems—like airport security teams in different countries sharing alerts.”*

### **Shared SOC**

📘 **Definition:**  
A Shared SOC is a collaborative model where multiple smaller organizations pool resources to operate a joint SOC for cost-effective threat monitoring and response.

🧠 **Example:**  
Several small healthcare providers share a SOC to monitor their networks and comply with data protection regulations.

*“A Shared SOC is like neighbors hiring one security guard to patrol all their homes—sharing protection and reducing costs.”*

### **MSSP (Managed Security Services Provider)**

📘 **Definition:**  
An MSSP is a third-party organization that provides outsourced cybersecurity services, including threat monitoring, incident response, and compliance management.

🧠 **Example:**  
A startup hires an MSSP to manage its firewall, SIEM, and endpoint protection due to limited in-house expertise.

*“An MSSP is like hiring a professional security company to protect your business—so you don’t have to build your own team.”*

### **Tier 1 Analyst (L1)**

📘 **Definition:**  
Tier 1 analysts are the first line of defense in a SOC. They monitor alerts, perform initial triage, and escalate incidents based on severity.

🧠 **Example:**  
An L1 analyst reviews a suspicious login alert and checks if it matches known attack patterns before escalating it to Tier 2.

*“Tier 1 analysts are like receptionists at a security desk—they spot unusual activity and notify the right team to investigate further.”*

### **Tier 2 Analyst (L2)**

📘 **Definition:**  
Tier 2 analysts investigate escalated alerts, perform deeper analysis, and coordinate incident response actions.

🧠 **Example:**  
An L2 analyst uses threat intelligence and log correlation to confirm a phishing attack and initiate containment steps.

*“Tier 2 analysts are like detectives—they dig deeper into suspicious activity to find out what really happened.”*

### **Tier 3 Analyst (L3)**

📘 **Definition:**  
Tier 3 analysts handle advanced threat hunting, malware analysis, and quality assurance. They also develop detection rules and improve SOC workflows.

🧠 **Example:**  
An L3 analyst creates a custom detection rule to identify lateral movement in the network using MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

*“Tier 3 analysts are like forensic experts—they uncover hidden threats and help prevent future attacks.”*

### **SOC Manager**

📘 **Definition:**  
The SOC Manager oversees the entire SOC team, ensures SLA compliance, manages escalations, and coordinates with other departments.

🧠 **Example:**  
The SOC Manager reviews incident reports, ensures timely resolution, and communicates findings to senior leadership.

*“The SOC Manager is like the head of security—making sure the team runs smoothly and responds effectively to threats.”*
