## 🔍 Definitions & Examples

### 1. What is Networking?

📘 **Definition**: Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and communicate using protocols.

🧠 **Example**: In a SOC, analysts monitor network traffic between internal systems and external servers to detect anomalies like data exfiltration.

_“Think of networking like a postal system—devices are houses, IP addresses are street addresses, and protocols are the rules for sending and receiving packages.”_

---

### Internet vs Intranet

#### Internet

📘 **Definition**: The Internet is a global network connecting millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks. It enables worldwide communication and access to information.

🧠 **Example**: Browsing websites, sending emails, and accessing cloud services all use the Internet.

_“The Internet is like a massive public highway system—anyone can travel anywhere, but security is needed to protect travelers.”_

#### Intranet

📘 **Definition**: An Intranet is a private network accessible only to an organization’s staff. It uses internet technologies (like web browsers and protocols) but is isolated from the public Internet.

🧠 **Example**: Employees accessing internal HR portals, company documents, or collaboration tools via the organization’s intranet.

_“An intranet is like a private road within a company—only authorized personnel can use it, and it’s protected from outside traffic.”_

#### Quick Comparison Table

| Feature         | Internet                          | Intranet                          |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Access**      | Public, global                    | Private, restricted to org users  |
| **Purpose**     | Global communication, info sharing| Internal communication, resources |
| **Security**    | Exposed, needs strong protection  | More secure, behind firewalls     |
| **Examples**    | Google, Facebook, Email           | HR portal, internal wiki          |

> **SOC Relevance:**  
SOC analysts monitor both Internet and intranet traffic. Internet-facing systems are more exposed to threats, while intranet monitoring helps detect insider threats and unauthorized access.



---

### 2. IP Addressing

📘 **Definition**: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, allowing it to send and receive data.

🧠 **Example**: A SOC analyst might investigate suspicious traffic from a private IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10) trying to connect to a known malicious public IP.

_“An IP address is like a phone number—each device has one so others can reach it directly.”_

#### IPv4 vs IPv6

📘 **Definition**: IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1), while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334) to support more devices.

🧠 **Example**: IPv6 is increasingly used in modern networks, and SOC tools like Wireshark can capture both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

_“IPv4 is like a small town with limited house numbers; IPv6 is a mega city with endless addresses.”_

#### Public vs Private IPs

📘 **Definition**: Public IPs are routable on the internet, while private IPs are used within internal networks and are not directly accessible from outside.

#### Quick Comparison: Private vs Public IP Addresses

| Feature            | Private IP Address                          | Public IP Address                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Usage**          | Internal networks (LAN, home, office)       | Internet-facing, accessible globally       |
| **Accessibility**  | Not reachable from the internet             | Reachable from anywhere on the internet    |
| **IP Ranges**      | 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255<br>172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255<br>192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | Any IP outside private ranges              |
| **Assigned By**    | Network administrator or DHCP server        | ISP (Internet Service Provider)            |
| **Security**       | More secure, hidden from external threats   | Exposed, needs protection (firewall, etc.) |
| **Example**        | 192.168.1.10                                | 8.8.8.8                                    |

> **Interview Tip:** Private IPs are used for internal communication and cannot be routed on the internet, while public IPs are used for devices that need to be accessible from outside the local network.

🧠 **Example**: SOC analysts often monitor traffic from private IPs to public IPs to detect unauthorized data transfers.

_“Private IPs are like internal office extensions; public IPs are direct phone lines to the outside world.”_

#### Classes of IP Addresses

IP addresses are divided into five classes (A, B, C, D, E) based on their leading bits and intended use:

| Class | Range (First Octet) | Default Subnet Mask | Usage                     |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| A     | 1 – 126             | 255.0.0.0           | Large networks            |
| B     | 128 – 191           | 255.255.0.0         | Medium-sized networks     |
| C     | 192 – 223           | 255.255.255.0       | Small networks            |
| D     | 224 – 239           | N/A                 | Multicast (not for hosts) |
| E     | 240 – 255           | N/A                 | Experimental/Reserved     |

> Note: 127.x.x.x is reserved for loopback addresses and not used for host assignment.

#### Other Special IP Ranges

- **Loopback:** 127.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255 (commonly 127.0.0.1, used for testing on the local machine)
- **Link-local (APIPA):** 169.254.0.0 – 169.254.255.255 (automatically assigned if DHCP fails)
- **Reserved:** 0.0.0.0/8 (used for default routes), 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.254 (reserved for future use)
- **Broadcast:** 255.255.255.255 (used to send messages to all hosts on a network)

_“Think of private IPs as internal office numbers, public IPs as external phone numbers, loopback as calling yourself, and link-local as a fallback number when the main system fails.”_

#### Quick Overview: IPv6

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the successor to IPv4, designed to address the limitations of IPv4’s address space. It uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for approximately 340 undecillion unique IPs—enough for every device on earth and beyond.

**Why IPv6 is Needed Over IPv4:**  
IPv4’s 32-bit address space supports about 4.3 billion unique addresses, which is insufficient for today’s global demand driven by mobile devices, IoT, and cloud services. IPv6 solves this shortage, enabling continued internet growth and connectivity.

**Key Features:**
- **Address Format:** Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`)
- **No Need for NAT:** Vast address space eliminates the need for Network Address Translation.
- **Built-in Security:** Supports IPsec for end-to-end encryption and authentication.
- **Simplified Header:** More efficient packet processing.

**SOC Relevance:**  
SOC analysts should be familiar with IPv6 traffic, as attackers may use it to bypass legacy security controls. Monitoring both IPv4 and IPv6 is essential for comprehensive network visibility.

_“IPv6 is like expanding from a small town to a global metropolis—there’s room for everyone, but new rules apply.”_

---

#### Subnetting

📘 **Definition**: Subnetting divides a network into smaller segments to improve performance and security.

🧠 **Example**: A SOC analyst may investigate traffic between subnets to detect lateral movement by attackers.

_“Subnetting is like dividing a building into departments—each has its own space but can still communicate.”_

#### Subnetting Explained for Beginners

Subnetting is the process of splitting a large network into smaller, more manageable pieces called subnets. This helps organize networks, improve security, and reduce congestion.

**Why Subnet?**
- To separate departments (e.g., HR, IT, Finance) so issues in one don’t affect others.
- To limit broadcast traffic and improve performance.
- To enhance security by isolating sensitive systems.

**Simple Example:**
Suppose you have a company with the network 192.168.1.0/24 (which allows 254 devices). You want to split it into two groups: one for staff and one for guests.

- **Subnet 1:** 192.168.1.0/25 (devices 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.126)
- **Subnet 2:** 192.168.1.128/25 (devices 192.168.1.129 – 192.168.1.254)

Now, staff and guests are on separate subnets, making it easier to manage and secure each group.

**Analogy:**  
_Think of subnetting like dividing a large apartment building into separate floors. Each floor (subnet) has its own set of apartments (devices), making it easier to manage mail delivery and security._

**CIDR Notation:**  
Subnetting often uses CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation, like `/24` or `/25`, to specify how many bits are used for the network part of the address.

| Subnet Mask     | CIDR | Number of Hosts |
| --------------- | ---- | --------------- |
| 255.255.255.0   | /24  | 254             |
| 255.255.255.128 | /25  | 126             |
| 255.255.255.192 | /26  | 62              |

**SOC Relevance:**  
SOC analysts may investigate suspicious activity moving between subnets, which could indicate an attacker trying to access different parts of the network.

### 3. Ports & Protocols

📘 **Definition**: Ports are logical endpoints for communication, and protocols define the rules for data exchange.

🧠 **Example**: Port 443 is used for HTTPS traffic. If malware communicates over this port, it may evade detection unless inspected deeply.

_“Ports are like doors in a building—each one leads to a specific service, and protocols are the rules for using those doors.”_

#### Understanding Port Ranges for Beginners

Ports are numbered from 0 to 65535 and are grouped into different ranges based on their usage and reservation status:

| Range            | Port Numbers  | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Well-known Ports | 0 – 1023      | Reserved for common protocols and services    |
| Registered Ports | 1024 – 49151  | Assigned for user or vendor-specific services |
| Dynamic/Private  | 49152 – 65535 | Used for temporary or private connections     |

**Reserved Ports:**  
Ports 0–1023 are reserved for system or widely-used services (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SSH).

**Non-Reserved Ports:**  
Ports 1024–65535 can be used by applications and are not reserved for specific services.

#### Top Common Ports Seen in SOC Environments

| Port | Protocol | Service     | Typical Use Case          |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| 20   | TCP      | FTP Data    | File transfers            |
| 21   | TCP      | FTP Control | File transfers            |
| 22   | TCP      | SSH         | Secure remote login       |
| 23   | TCP      | Telnet      | Unsecured remote login    |
| 25   | TCP      | SMTP        | Email sending             |
| 53   | UDP/TCP  | DNS         | Domain name resolution    |
| 80   | TCP      | HTTP        | Web traffic (unencrypted) |
| 110  | TCP      | POP3        | Email retrieval           |
| 143  | TCP      | IMAP        | Email retrieval           |
| 443  | TCP      | HTTPS       | Secure web traffic        |
| 3389 | TCP      | RDP         | Remote Desktop Protocol   |

> **SOC Tip:** Attackers may use common ports (like 80 or 443) to disguise malicious traffic. Monitoring both reserved and non-reserved ports helps analysts spot unusual activity.

_Think of well-known ports as main entrances to a building (everyone knows them), while higher-numbered ports are like side doors or temporary access points._

#### IP, TCP, and UDP: Protocols Explained

##### What is IP?

📘 **Definition**: IP (Internet Protocol) is the fundamental protocol that assigns unique addresses to devices and routes data packets between them across networks.

🧠 **Example**: When you visit a website, your device uses IP to find and communicate with the web server’s address.

_“IP is like the addressing system for mail—every device gets a unique address so data knows where to go.”_

---

#### TCP vs UDP

📘 **Definition**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two main transport protocols. TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, ensuring data arrives correctly and in order. UDP is connectionless, faster, but less reliable, sending data without guarantees.

🧠 **Example**: DNS uses UDP for quick lookups; SOC tools monitor both TCP and UDP traffic for anomalies.

_“TCP is like sending registered mail with tracking; UDP is like dropping a postcard in the mailbox.”_

---

#### Comparison: TCP vs UDP

| Feature            | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)                                 | UDP (User Datagram Protocol)                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Connection**     | Connection-oriented (establishes a connection before data transfer) | Connectionless (no setup required)             |
| **Reliability**    | Reliable (guarantees delivery, retransmits lost packets)            | Unreliable (no guarantee of delivery or order) |
| **Ordering**       | Ensures data arrives in order                                       | No ordering; packets may arrive out of order   |
| **Error Checking** | Yes (error detection and correction)                                | Yes (error detection only, no correction)      |
| **Speed**          | Slower due to overhead                                              | Faster, minimal overhead                       |
| **Use Cases**      | Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP)        | Streaming, VoIP, DNS, online gaming            |
| **Header Size**    | Larger (20 bytes minimum)                                           | Smaller (8 bytes)                              |
| **Flow Control**   | Yes                                                                 | No                                             |

---
#### Protocols Overview

| Protocol | Layer in OSI Model  | Function                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IP**   | Layer 3 (Network)   | Provides logical addressing and routing of packets between devices/networks. |
| **TCP**  | Layer 4 (Transport) | Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.               |
| **UDP**  | Layer 4 (Transport) | Enables fast, connectionless, and unreliable data transfer.                  |

> **Note:** IP is responsible for addressing and routing, while TCP and UDP handle how data is transported between endpoints.

### 4. Network Devices

📘 **Definition**: Network devices are hardware or software components that facilitate, manage, and optimize the flow of data across networks.

🧠 **Example**: In a SOC, analysts may monitor logs from routers and load balancers to identify unusual traffic patterns or potential attacks.

_“Routers are like traffic cops directing cars between highways, switches are intersection managers within a city, and load balancers are organizers that distribute cars evenly across multiple lanes.”_

#### Common Network Devices

- **Router**
    - Connects different networks (e.g., home network to the internet).
    - Routes data packets based on IP addresses.
    - Can perform Network Address Translation (NAT) to allow multiple devices to share a single public IP.

- **Switch**
    - Connects devices within the same local area network (LAN).
    - Forwards data based on MAC addresses.
    - Reduces congestion by sending data only to the intended recipient.

- **Load Balancer**
    - Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
    - Ensures no single server becomes overwhelmed, improving performance and reliability.
    - Can help defend against certain types of attacks (e.g., DDoS) by spreading out the load.

**Key Differences:**
- Routers operate at Layer 3 (Network), switches at Layer 2 (Data Link), and load balancers typically at Layer 4 (Transport) or Layer 7 (Application).
- Routers connect networks, switches connect devices within a network, and load balancers optimize resource usage across servers.

---

### 5. Security Devices

📘 **Definition**: Security devices are specialized tools designed to detect, prevent, and respond to threats by monitoring and controlling network traffic.

🧠 **Example**: SOC analysts use SIEMs to correlate alerts from firewalls, IDS/IPS, and endpoint security tools to identify coordinated attacks.

_“Firewalls are security guards at the gate, IDS/IPS are surveillance cameras, SIEMs are the central command center, and proxies are intermediaries that check credentials before letting anyone in.”_

#### 📚 Scenario: User Connecting to Our Server (Inbound Flow Explained Step-by-Step)

Let’s walk through what happens when an external user tries to access a company web server:

1. **🌐 Internet:**  
    The user initiates a connection from their device over the internet, targeting your organization’s public IP address.

2. **🛡️ Firewall:**  
    The firewall receives the inbound request first. It checks security rules to decide whether to allow or block the traffic (e.g., only permitting traffic on port 443 for HTTPS).

3. **🕵️ IDS/IPS:**  
    If allowed, the traffic passes to the IDS/IPS, which inspects packets for signs of attacks (like SQL injection or malware). If a threat is detected, it can alert or block the connection.

4. **⚖️ Load Balancer:**  
    Safe traffic is then sent to the load balancer, which distributes requests across multiple web servers to ensure reliability and performance.

5. **🖥️ Web Server:**  
    The selected web server processes the user’s request (e.g., serving a webpage or handling a login).

6. **🦠 EDR/Antivirus:**  
    The web server’s endpoint protection scans for malware or suspicious activity, helping prevent compromise if the request contains malicious content.

7. **🗄️ DLP:**  
    Data Loss Prevention tools monitor for attempts to access or exfiltrate sensitive data, ensuring confidential information isn’t leaked.

**SOC Analyst’s Perspective:**  
At each step, logs and alerts are generated. SOC analysts monitor these to detect, investigate, and respond to threats—ensuring that even if one layer is bypassed, others provide protection.

_This layered approach is called “Defense in Depth”—multiple controls working together to secure the network._

#### 📚 Scenario: User Accessing an External Server (Outbound Flow Explained Step-by-Step)

Let’s break down what happens when a corporate user tries to access an external website:

1. **👤 User Machine:**  
    The user initiates a request (e.g., browsing to google.com) from their workstation inside the corporate network.

2. **🕸️ Proxy:**  
    The request first goes to the proxy server, which enforces web usage policies, filters content, and may log or block access to restricted sites.

3. **🛡️ Firewall:**  
    The proxy forwards allowed requests to the firewall, which checks outbound rules to permit or deny traffic (e.g., only allowing HTTP/HTTPS ports).

4. **🌐 Internet:**  
    If permitted, the firewall sends the request out to the internet, where it travels to the destination server.

5. **🖥️ Google Server:**  
    The external server (e.g., Google) receives the request and responds, sending data back through the same path.

**SOC Analyst’s Perspective:**  
At each step, logs are generated—proxies log user activity, firewalls log outbound connections, and alerts may be triggered for policy violations or suspicious destinations. SOC analysts monitor these logs to detect data exfiltration, policy bypass attempts, or connections to malicious sites.

_This outbound flow ensures that user activity is filtered, monitored, and controlled before reaching the internet, providing multiple layers of defense._



> - **Tip:** Use arrows (⬇️ for inbound/ingress/download, ⬆️ for outbound/egress/upload) to visualize traffic direction and data movement.
>    - ⬇️ **Inbound / Ingress / Download:** Traffic entering the network or downloading data (e.g., external users accessing internal servers, files being downloaded).
>    - ⬆️ **Outbound / Egress / Upload:** Traffic leaving the network or uploading data (e.g., internal users accessing external resources, files being uploaded).

### 🛡️ Defense in Depth & SOC Monitoring

- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers (🛡️🕵️⚖️🦠🗄️🕸️) ensure if one is bypassed, others protect the network.
- **SIEM** (📊) collects logs/alerts from all devices for centralized monitoring and correlation.
- **DLP** (🗄️) monitors for sensitive data exfiltration on outbound traffic.

### 7. DNS and Name Resolution

📘 **Definition**: DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical system that translates human-friendly domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses that computers use to communicate.

🧠 **Example**: When you type `www.google.com` in your browser, DNS resolves it to an IP address so your device can connect to the correct server.

_“DNS is like a phonebook for the internet—translating names into numbers so devices can find each other.”_

#### How DNS Name Resolution Works

![DNS Name Resolution](image.png)
Reference: [TCP/IP Guide](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_DNSNameResolutionProcess-2.htm)

1. **User Request**: You enter a domain name in your browser.
2. **DNS Query**: Your device asks a DNS resolver for the IP address.
3. **Recursive Lookup**: The resolver queries root, TLD, and authoritative DNS servers.
4. **Response**: The resolver returns the IP address to your device.
5. **Connection**: Your device connects to the server using the resolved IP.


#### Common DNS Record Types and Their Security Relevance

| Record Type | Purpose                                           | Example                                              | Security Monitoring Use                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**       | Maps a domain to an IPv4 address                  | `example.com` → `93.184.216.34`                      | Monitor for suspicious or unexpected IP changes (e.g., domain hijacking, C2 infrastructure) |
| **AAAA**    | Maps a domain to an IPv6 address                  | `example.com` → `2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946` | Similar to A records, watch for malicious IPv6 usage                                        |
| **CNAME**   | Alias for another domain name                     | `www.example.com` → `example.com`                    | Detect abuse of aliases for phishing or redirecting traffic                                 |
| **MX**      | Specifies mail servers for a domain               | `example.com` → `mail.example.com`                   | Monitor for changes that could indicate email spoofing or phishing setup                    |
| **TXT**     | Holds arbitrary text (often for SPF, DKIM, DMARC) | SPF: `v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all`          | Check for unauthorized changes that weaken email security or enable spoofing                |
| **NS**      | Delegates a domain to DNS servers                 | `example.com` → `ns1.example.com`                    | Watch for unauthorized changes that could redirect all domain traffic                       |
| **PTR**     | Maps IP addresses to domain names (reverse DNS)   | `34.216.184.93.in-addr.arpa` → `example.com`         | Useful for attribution and detecting suspicious infrastructure                              |
| **SRV**     | Specifies services and ports for a domain         | `_sip._tcp.example.com`                              | Monitor for unexpected services being advertised                                            |
| **SOA**     | Start of Authority, holds admin info and settings | Contains serial, refresh, and contact info           | Changes may indicate domain takeover attempts                                               |

### Common DNS-Based Attacks and Mitigation

#### Common DNS-Based Attacks
- **DNS Spoofing/Poisoning:** Attackers corrupt DNS cache to redirect users to malicious sites.
- **DNS Tunneling:** Uses DNS queries to exfiltrate data or establish covert communication channels.
- **Domain Hijacking:** Unauthorized changes to DNS records to take control of a domain.
- **Phishing via Malicious Domains:** Registering lookalike domains to trick users.
- **DDoS via DNS Amplification:** Exploiting open DNS resolvers to overwhelm targets with traffic.

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Regularly monitor and audit DNS records for unauthorized changes.
- Use DNSSEC to authenticate DNS responses and prevent spoofing.
- Restrict DNS resolver access and disable open recursion.
- Implement threat intelligence feeds to block known malicious domains.
- Analyze DNS logs for unusual query patterns or data exfiltration attempts.
- Enforce least privilege on DNS administration and use strong authentication.

---
**SOC Relevance:**  
- Monitoring DNS records is crucial for detecting domain hijacking, phishing, command and control (C2) infrastructure, and misconfigurations.
- Early identification of unauthorized or suspicious DNS changes can help prevent attacks.
- DNS logs provide valuable insights for spotting unusual queries, detecting data exfiltration via DNS tunneling, and identifying malware communications.
- SOC analysts review DNS logs to spot suspicious domain lookups, which may indicate malware activity or phishing attempts.

### 8. DHCP

📘 **Definition**: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration details to devices on a network.

🧠 **Example**: When you connect your laptop to Wi-Fi, DHCP gives it an IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS server information.

_“DHCP is like a hotel front desk assigning room numbers and keys to guests as they check in.”_

#### How DHCP Works

1. **Discovery**: Device broadcasts a request for an IP address.
2. **Offer**: DHCP server responds with an available IP address.
3. **Request**: Device requests to use the offered IP.
4. **Acknowledgment**: DHCP server confirms and assigns the IP.

![DHCP](image-1.png)
Reference: [TeleDynamics ](https://info.teledynamics.com/blog/dhcp-options-for-voip-and-uc-systems)

**SOC Relevance**: Monitoring DHCP logs helps analysts track device connections, detect unauthorized devices, and investigate suspicious network activity.
